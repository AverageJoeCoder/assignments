One day Jon was just playing games on his computer when suddenly he gets an email from rackspace, he opens up the email and it reads
"You got the job! in order to start your first day you just need to go to this link https://notascam.com"
He clicks on the link because he has no life or brain, and then "Rackspace" who is actually a hacker from a remote location and the hacker
is able to steal his credit card information and passwords.
